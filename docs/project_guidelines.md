# Gesture API Project Guidelines

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

- Maintain the modular structure outlined in the project layout.
- Use relative imports within your project to ensure portability.
- Keep main application logic in the `src` directory.
- Use `main.py` as the primary entry point for your application.
- Separate concerns: each module (`hand_tracking`, `gesture_recognition`, etc.) should have a specific, well-defined purpose.

## 2. Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose.
- Write docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Use type hints to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors.

## 3. Version Control

- Use Git for version control.
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pyc` files).
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or major changes.

## 4. Dependencies Management

- Maintain an up-to-date `requirements.txt` file.
- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.
- Regularly update dependencies and check for security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Testing

- Write unit tests for all modules in the `tests` directory.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical functionality.
- Use pytest as the testing framework.
- Include integration tests to ensure different modules work together correctly.

## 6. Documentation

- Maintain a comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Usage examples
  - API documentation
- Use inline comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious code.
- Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves.

## 7. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement proper error handling and raise appropriate exceptions.
- Use Python's logging module for debugging and monitoring.
- Create informative error messages to aid in troubleshooting.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Profile your code to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient processing.
- Consider multithreading or multiprocessing for CPU-intensive tasks.

## 9. API Design

- Design a clean, intuitive API for external usage.
- Use RESTful principles if creating a web API.
- Implement proper input validation and error handling in the API.
- Version your API to allow for future changes without breaking existing integrations.

## 10. Security

- Sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks.
- If implementing user authentication, use secure methods and libraries.
- Be cautious about storing or logging sensitive information.

## 11. Scalability and Extensibility

- Design your modules to be easily extendable for future features.
- Use abstract base classes or interfaces where appropriate to define common behavior.
- Consider using design patterns to solve common problems in a standardized way.

## 12. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment.
- Ensure all tests pass before merging changes into the main branch.

## 13. Code Reviews

- Implement a code review process for all significant changes.
- Use pull requests to facilitate code reviews and discussions.

## 14. Licensing

- Choose an appropriate open-source license for your project.
- Include the license text in your repository.

Remember, these guidelines are adaptable. As your project evolves, revisit and adjust these guidelines to best suit your development process and project needs.
