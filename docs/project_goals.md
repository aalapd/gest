### **Project Overview: Gesture API for Game Control**

This project aims to build a gesture-based API that uses a webcam to detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time. The API will initially translate gestures into mouse movements and clicks, with the goal of controlling a simple 2D game. The project uses Python and OpenCV, leveraging MediaPipe for hand and finger tracking.

Key aspects include:
- **Hand & Finger Tracking**: Using a webcam, the API will track both hands and fingers in real-time, detecting a range of gestures.
- **Mouse Control via Gestures**: The API will interpret these gestures to move the mouse, click, and potentially trigger other simple inputs.
- **Game Integration**: The API will provide input to a 2D game, allowing for interaction through gestures. The game engine (yet to be determined) will receive feedback from the API to control gameplay elements.

#### **Phase 1: Setup & Gesture Detection**

The goal of Phase 1 is to set up the core components of hand tracking and basic gesture detection using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This phase will establish the foundation for recognizing hand landmarks and detecting specific gestures.

##### **Key Steps**:
1. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
   - Install required libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, and other dependencies.
   - Configure the webcam for capturing video frames in real-time using OpenCV.

2. **Implement Hand Tracking with MediaPipe**:
   - Use MediaPipe’s hand detection model to identify 21 key landmarks on both hands (covering finger joints, tips, and palm).
   - Convert the webcam’s video feed to frames, pass them through MediaPipe’s hand tracking model, and visualize the detected landmarks on the video.

3. **Basic Gesture Detection**:
   - Start with basic gestures like detecting an open hand, closed fist, or pinching fingers.
   - Calculate distances between landmarks to classify gestures. For example:
     - **Mouse Movement**: When the palm is open and facing the camera, track the index finger's position to control the mouse cursor. Make sure there is some padding on each side of the screen so that the position of the hand does not need be at the very egde of the camera view for the pointer to be at the edge of the screen.
     - **Mouse Clicking**: Trigger left and right-click actions with a two-finger pinch and a "hand purse" gesture, respectively.
     - **Mouse Scroll**: Trigger mouse scroll actions when the pointer finger and middle finger are pointed at the screen and wrist is rotated up or down.

4. **Test the Hand Tracking**:
   - Ensure the system works across various lighting conditions and hand positions.
   - Test the tracking accuracy and optimize for real-time performance.

##### **Deliverables of Phase 1**:
- Functional hand and finger tracking using MediaPipe.
- Basic gesture recognition (open hand, closed fist, pinch).
- Visualization of hand landmarks on the webcam feed.

#### **Phase 2: API Development & Integration**

In Phase 2, the focus shifts to translating recognized gestures into mouse control and building an API that other systems, including game engines, can interface with.

##### **Key Steps**:
1. **Develop Gesture-to-Action Mapping**:
   - Map recognized gestures to specific mouse actions using Python libraries like `pyautogui` or `pynput`.
     - **Mouse Movement**: Control the cursor’s X, Y coordinates based on open-palm hand position when the palm is facing the camera.
     - **Mouse Click**: Same as above, but trigger left and right-click actions.
     - **Mouse Scroll**: Same as above, but trigger mouse scroll actions.

2. **Build the API**:
   - Design and implement a lightweight API that exposes the gesture data and controls mouse events.
   - Ensure the API can be called by external applications (e.g., a game engine or another program) to retrieve gesture inputs.
   - Use frameworks like `Flask` or `FastAPI` if you want the API to run as a service that other applications can communicate with.

3. **Integrate with a Simple Game**:
   - Develop a prototype 2D game or use an existing engine to test the API.
   - The game should be able to accept inputs from the gesture API to control elements like character movement or object interaction based on detected hand gestures.

4. **Testing & Refinement**:
   - Thoroughly test the API for responsiveness, accuracy, and latency.
   - Refine the gesture recognition logic based on real-world use cases and feedback from testing in different environments.

##### **Deliverables of Phase 2**:
- A functional API that converts gestures into mouse movements and clicks.
- Integration with a simple 2D game for testing gesture-based interactions.
- Refined gesture recognition and improved performance based on testing.

### **Summary**

This project sets the foundation for gesture-based control in games using Python and OpenCV. In **Phase 1**, you’ll build the core functionality for hand and finger tracking using MediaPipe and implement basic gesture recognition. In **Phase 2**, you’ll develop an API to translate these gestures into mouse movements and clicks and integrate this with a 2D game.

This approach ensures a modular, scalable solution that begins with simple hand gestures and mouse control but can later be extended for more complex interactions.
